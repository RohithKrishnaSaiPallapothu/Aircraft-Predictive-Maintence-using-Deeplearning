## Project Overview

Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is critical in aviation to prevent catastrophic failures and reduce maintenance costs. This project implements a data-driven framework to predict the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan jet engines.

Moving beyond traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (like LSTMs), this project proposes a **Hybrid Architecture**:

1. **1D-CNN:** For automatic feature extraction from multivariate time-series sensor data.

2. **Liquid Neural Network (LNN):** A novel, adaptive recurrent neural network modeled by differential equations, capable of handling non-stationary and noisy data streams more effectively than static RNNs.

The system is trained on the NASA C-MAPSS benchmark and deployed via a user-friendly **Streamlit Interface** for real-time engine health monitoring.

## The Dataset

We utilized the **NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS)** dataset. It consists of four sub-datasets with varying complexity:

| Dataset | Train Trajectories | Test Trajectories | Operational Conditions | Fault Modes | Complexity |

| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |

| **FD001** | 100 | 100 | 1 | 1 | Lowest |

| **FD002** | 260 | 259 | 6 | 1 | High (Complex Ops) |

| **FD003** | 100 | 100 | 1 | 2 | Medium (Complex Faults) |

| **FD004** | 249 | 248 | 6 | 2 | Highest (Real-world sim) |

*Input Data:* 21 sensors (Temperature, Pressure, Fan Speeds) and 3 operational settings.

---

## Methodology & Architecture

The pipeline consists of three main stages:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* **RUL Calculation:** Derived target labels from run-to-failure cycles.

* **RUL Clipping:** Capped max RUL at **125 cycles** to focus learning on the critical degradation phase.

* **Feature Selection:** Removed static sensor columns with zero variance.

* **Normalization:** Applied `MinMaxScaler` to scale sensor readings to [0, 1].

* **Sliding Window:** Generated 3D sequences with a **Window Size of 40**.

### 2. The Hybrid Model

* **Input Layer:** Takes sequence shape `(Batch, 40, Features)`.

* **Feature Extractor (1D-CNN):** Two convolutional layers with ReLU activation and Max Pooling to identify local sensor patterns.

* **Temporal Core (LNN):** A `LiquidNet` layer (based on ODEs) processes the CNN output to capture long-term temporal dependencies and degradation trends.

* **Regressor (Output Head):** Fully connected layers map the LNN state to a single continuous RUL value.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics

* **RMSE:** Root Mean Squared Error (Precision).

* **Asymmetric C-MAPSS Score:** A domain-specific metric that penalizes late predictions (false negatives) more heavily than early ones.

##  Usage

### 1. Training the Model

To reproduce the training results or retrain on new data:

1\. Open `Capstone(LNN).ipynb` in Jupyter Lab, Google Colab, or VS Code.

2\. Ensure dataset files are in the correct path.

3\. Run the cells sequentially. The notebook handles data loading, preprocessing, training loop, and saving the best models/scalers.

### 2. Running the Web App

To launch the interactive dashboard:

```bash

python -m streamlit run app.py


##  Results

Our specialized tuning strategy yielded significant improvements over baseline LSTM models.

| Dataset | Complexity | Final RMSE (Cycles) | Final C-MAPSS Score |
